**Voice Quality**

Americans tend to be a little louder than you're accustomed to. The stereotypical American is louder, a little brasher, more boisterous, immediately friendly, informal, and slightly jokey.
美国人讲话的音量往往比你习惯的大一点。典型的美国人嗓门更大，有点自以为是，更吵闹，很友善，不拘礼节，还有点开玩笑。


**Pitch 音高**

Generally speaking, to Americans, a higher pitch indicates stress or tension, and they will repond accordingly, even if you are not stressed.
So, mmake a conscious effort to match your speaking voice in English to your deepest voice in your own language.
一般来讲，美国人认为高音调意味着压力和紧张。
所以要有意识的用你说母语时最深沉的音色来说英语。


**The Underlying Hum 不明显的哼哼声**

You want to keep the vibration going from one word to the next, gluing the whole phrase together。
不明显的哼哼声和你的喉咙有关，你需要让喉咙从一个单词到下一个单词之间保持震动，让整个短语连接起来。

American English is generated in the back of the mouth and the throat.Like *Bob got a water bottle*
美式英语由口腔靠后的部位和喉咙发音。


**Synonyms 同义词**

Americans consider it awkward, both in speech and in writing, for a single word or phrase to be repeated more than twice.
美式英语一个重要的特点是大量的使用同义词。


**Nonsense Syllables 无意义的音节**

如日语里的eto ne, 在日本人正在努力思考但还讲不出来的时候使用。
英语中有：
Oops!  I don't know. Hmm... Humph! I get it. Eureka! 
Yes. Oh, really. Oh, I see.
No. No way! I did not!
类似的还有引入语Run-up Phrases
Well, you know, I was just thinking, and it kinda seems like, uhh, what do you think about...
